            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, as a Software Engineering Intern at Red Hat, Iâ€™ve gotten deeper into Open Source and Software Engineering in general â€” and along the way, Iâ€™ve picked up a lot. From managing dependencies in Node.js, exploring containerization, navigating GitHub Workflows, becoming a maintainer in the Backstage project, to even giving presentations and submitting proposals for tech conferences â€” itâ€™s been a learning curve (in the best way).
At some point, I realized I wanted a place to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on what Iâ€™m <span class="glow_highlight_dmJa">learning</span></li>
<li>Share the <span class="glow_highlight_dmJa">contributions</span> I make to open source projects</li>
<li>Write about <span class="glow_highlight_dmJa">dev concepts</span> that interest me</li>
<li>Keep track of my <span class="glow_highlight_dmJa">growth</span> as a developer</li>
</ul>
<p>This blog is that space.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s for me, but also for anyone else who might find value in the journey â€” especially if youâ€™re starting out or exploring similar paths.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s see where this goes ðŸŒ±</p>]]></content:encoded>
