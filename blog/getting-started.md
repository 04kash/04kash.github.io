Over the last year, as a Software Engineering Intern at Red Hat, Iâ€™ve gotten deeper into Open Source and Software Engineering in general â€” and along the way, Iâ€™ve picked up a lot. From managing dependencies in Node.js, exploring containerization, navigating GitHub Workflows, becoming a maintainer in the Backstage project, to even giving presentations and submitting proposals for tech conferences â€” itâ€™s been a learning curve (in the best way).
At some point, I realized I wanted a place to:

- Reflect on what Iâ€™m <span className={clsx(styles.glow_highlight)}>learning</span>
- Share the <span className={clsx(styles.glow_highlight)}>contributions</span> I make to open source projects
- Write about <span className={clsx(styles.glow_highlight)}>dev concepts</span> that interest me
- Keep track of my <span className={clsx(styles.glow_highlight)}>growth</span> as a developer

This blog is that space.

Itâ€™s for me, but also for anyone else who might find value in the journey â€” especially if youâ€™re starting out or exploring similar paths.

Letâ€™s see where this goes ðŸŒ±
